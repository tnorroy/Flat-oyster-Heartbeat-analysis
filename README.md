# Flat-oyster-Heartbeat-analysis
Processing and statistical analysis of heartbeat data from 10 flat oysters subjected to different temperature conditions

The csv file is the file obtained with the "ScriptBPM_Amp.R" code from the raw data from the heart sensors on the oysters. 
The "rolling_avg - Copy.R" file contains the functions required to run this code. 

The main file is "Heartbeat_analysis.R", which uses the supplied csv file and performs the statistical analysis. 

The internship report detailing the method and analysis is available in pdf format.
